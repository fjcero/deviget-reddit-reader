# Dev I Get - Front-end Challange - Reddit Reader

## How I Started

```bash
$ npx create-react-app deviget-reddit-reader
$ nvm use stable
$ echo $(nvm current) > .nvmrc
$ vim .editorconfig
$ yarn start
```

## Strategy

Will use `top-down` strategy to start creating components and logic. This will reduce the amount of opinionated code and will allow to extend the application in the next steps.

First step is to connect to Reddit and get some information from the list of posts. To accomplish that will fetch data from Root component, `App` in this case.
